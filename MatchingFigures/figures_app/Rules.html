    <h1>Welcome to the Figure Matching Game!</h1>
    <p>You and your partner will be given 5 images BUT in different orders. You must determine which figure in your set corresponds to which figure in your partner's set. One of you will write down the answers. For example:</p>
    <p><i>“My Figure 1 corresponds to Figure number ... on my partner's screen”. </i></p>
    <p>For each correct answer, you and your partner will receive 1 point. You have 4 minutes to complete each game. If you end the task earlier, you have to wait the remaining time.</p>
    <p>You will play 4 games with different players. You may need to wait for up to 16 minutes without playing if your next player isn't available right away. In this case, please wait online <b>without closing the webpage</b>, until your co-player is available.</p>
    <p><b>Good luck!</b></p>
