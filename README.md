# TalkingGame
An oTree game developed for the purpose of getting participants to communicate with each other. 


## Dependencies
- OTree: https://www.otree.org/

## How to run
Currently only the demo can be run. To run a devserver, cd into the [Otree Project Folder](MatchingFigures/), then run
```sh
otree devserver
```
Open [the link](http://localhost:8000) as prompted, lick on either the session link or the single-use links. 
The page should like something like [this](https://github.com/moyasui/TalkingGame/blob/main/Demo/Figure%20Matching%20Game.html).
